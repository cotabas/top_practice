# The Odin Project
This is all of the projects and bits of code I've created while going through the Odin project

**Command line highlights:** 

find the shortest path a chess knight piece can take from one posistion to another using a graph and depth first traversal

a connect four game with a testing suite



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS


## Lessons Learned:

A lot of the stuff in here was a nice refresher on basic programing concepts and HTML/css

Recreating the enumerable methods was a great way to understand these functions that I use so much

Linked list, binary tree, and graph creation taught me so much, and really solidified my understanding of concepts I already learned
